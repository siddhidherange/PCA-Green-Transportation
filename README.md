# 🌱 PCA – Green Transportation

*Principal Component Analysis (PCA)* is a machine learning technique used for *dimensionality reduction*.  
When a dataset contains many related variables (like EV usage, bike lanes, pollution levels, and public transport share), it becomes difficult to identify patterns manually. PCA solves this by:

- Standardizing features to a common scale
- Finding correlations between variables
- Transforming them into *new axes (principal components)* that capture maximum variance
- Allowing us to visualize and compare high-dimensional data using just 2–3 components

In short, PCA keeps *the most meaningful information* and removes noise, making trends easier to understand and act on—perfect for sustainability analysis.

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze green mobility data and reduce complex transportation and environmental metrics into a smaller set of key components for easier interpretation.

---

## 🔍 Workflow
- Load and explore dataset
- Clean and preprocess features
- Standardize numeric values (so all features contribute equally)
- Apply PCA to extract major components
- Visualize component scores and explained variance

---

## 🌍 Insights
- Identify which features influence greener mobility the most
- Compare sustainability performance across cities or regions
- Detect hidden clusters or similarities between areas
- Understand how transport choices relate to emissions

## 🛠 Tools
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
